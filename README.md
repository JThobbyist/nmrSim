# nmrSim
A simulator to provide practice for the commandline interface of the NMR machines at Columbia University

#### getting started:
##### Windows: 
1) download the config file (nmrSim.cfg.txt) and the .exe file
2) making sure that the .exe and the config file are in the same folder, run the .exe

##### Linux:
1) download the config file and the .rar archive
2) extract the linux executable "nmrSim v1.0 (linux)" from the archive and put it in the same folder as the config file
3) run the executable

(the linux file was too big to upload without compressing it into the .rar archive, apologies for the inconvenience linux people)
